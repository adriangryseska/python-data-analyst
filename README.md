# Python Data Analyst Portfolio

This project showcases a collection of data analysis work and techniques using Python, aimed at helping to analyze datasets, create visualizations, and provide insights. The projects demonstrate skills in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and data visualization with Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and more.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Techniques to clean and prepare raw datasets for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Create meaningful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to help interpret data insights.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Applying statistical techniques to find trends, outliers, and patterns in the data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigating datasets to uncover underlying patterns, correlations, and insights.

## Technologies Used

- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing and handling of large datasets.
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization library for creating static, animated, and interactive plots.
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization built on top of Matplotlib.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For creating and sharing data analysis projects.
